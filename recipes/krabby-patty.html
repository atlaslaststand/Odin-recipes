    <h1>Krabby Patty</h1>

    <img src="../krabby-patty.jpeg">

    <p>This is a krabby patty from the tv show spongebob squarepants. I cant really tell you the whole recipe because the
         krabby patty secret formula formula is a heavily guarded secret.
          We are working closely with someone who is trying to get that secret formula, but so far he has been unsuccessful</p>

          <p>This sandwich has been adored by many including king neptune. If you would like to try this sandwich you will have to go to bikini bottom.
            It's a little far but with a good submarine and some quality scuba gear you can defintely get there.
